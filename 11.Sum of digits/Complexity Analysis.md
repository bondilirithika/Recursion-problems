# Time complexity:

- The recursive functions runs for the no.of digits present in the given number
- The given number is repeatedly divided by 10
- Hence the time complexity is logarithmic with base 10
- **TOTAL**:O(logn)

# Space Complexity:
- The recursion stack takes the max space of O(logn) as the recursion depth can go till the number of igits that is proportional to logn
- **TOTAL**:O(logn)
