# Delete Middle of Linked List

Given a singly linked list, delete the middle of the linked list.

**Note:**

If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element.

If the input linked list has a single node, then it should return NULL.
# Examples:

**Input:** LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5

**Output:** 1->2->4->5
