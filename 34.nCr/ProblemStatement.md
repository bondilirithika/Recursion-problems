# nCr

Given two integers n and r, find nCr. Since the answer may be very large, calculate the answer modulo 10^9+7.
Note : If r is greater than n, return 0.

## Example 1:

### Input: n = 3, r = 2
### Output: 3
### Explaination: 3C2 = 3. 
## Example 2:

### Input: n = 2, r = 4
### Output: 0
### Explaination: r is greater than n.

# Expected Complexity
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*r)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(r)

# Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

1 ≤ r ≤ 800
