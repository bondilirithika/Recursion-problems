# Example 1:

### **Input:**
n = 4
### Output: 
7
### Explanation:
Given 4, its gray code =  110.
Binary equivalent of the gray code 110 is 100.
Return 7 representing gray code 100.
# Example 2:

### Input: 
n = 15
### Output: 
10
### Explanation:
Given 15 representing gray code 1000.
Binary equivalent of gray code 1000 is 1111.
Return 10 representing gray code 1111 
ie binary 1010.

# Expected complexity

Expected Time Complexity: O(log (n)).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

# Constraints:
0 <= n <= 10^9
