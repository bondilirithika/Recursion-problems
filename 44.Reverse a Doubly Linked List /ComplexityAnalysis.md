# ITERATIVE:

## Time complexity:
- In the while loop,we traverse each node exactly once,so the loop runs for n times where n is the number of nodes
- Time complexity:O(n)
## Space Complexity:
- Here we are only using variables such as temp,prev,front which takes constant space
- Space complexity:O(1)

# RECURSIVE:

## Time complexity:
- In therecursive function also we traverse each node exactly once,so the function runs for n times where n is the number of nodes
- Time complexity:O(n)
## Space Complexity:
- Due to the recursive stack that has max depth of n where n is the no.of nodes,the space complexity becomes O(n)
- Except that,we use constant space
- Space complexity:O(n)
