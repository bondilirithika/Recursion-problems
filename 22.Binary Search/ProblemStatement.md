# Binary Search

Given a sorted array arr and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search.

# Examples:

**Input:** k = 4, arr= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  

**Output**: 3

**Explanation:** 4 appears at index 3.

**Input:** k = 445, arr= [11, 22, 33, 44, 55] 

**Output:** -1

**Explanation**: 445 is not present.

# Expected complexity
Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)

Expected Space Complexity: O(logn) 


# Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

1 <= k <= 10^6
