# Time Complexity

- The binary search algorithm reduces the search interval by half with each recursive call.
- Therefore, the time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

# Space Complexity

- The space complexity is due to the recursion stack, which has a maximum depth of `O(log n)`.
