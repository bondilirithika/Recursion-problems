## Code Overview

The `floodFill` method performs a flood fill operation on a 2D grid. It starts from a given pixel and replaces all connected pixels with the same initial color with a new color. This is typically used in image processing and is implemented using a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

# Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal**: The `solve` method is a recursive DFS function that traverses all connected pixels with the same initial color. In the worst case, it might need to visit every pixel in the image, which results in a time complexity of `O(R * C)`, where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Processing Each Pixel**: Each pixel is processed once, and there are no redundant computations or repeated visits due to the check `ans[sr][sc] != newColor`.

**Total Time Complexity**:

`O(R * C)`

# Space Complexity

- **Recursive Stack**: The space used by the recursion stack is proportional to the depth of the recursion, which in the worst case can be as deep as the number of pixels in the grid. Thus, the space complexity for the recursive stack is `O(R * C)` in the worst case.
- **Output Grid**: The space required for the output grid `ans` is `O(R * C)`.

**Total Space Complexity**:

`O(R * C)`

# Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Recursive Stack**: The main auxiliary space usage is the recursion stack, which in the worst case can grow to `O(R * C)`.

**Total Auxiliary Space Complexity**:

`O(R * C)`

where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns in the grid.
