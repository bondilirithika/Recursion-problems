# 1. Game Development (Area of Effect in Strategy Games)
- Scenario: "In a real-time strategy game, you need to implement a mechanic where a character casts an area-of-effect spell that affects all units or objects within a region. The spell affects only those units that share the same state (e.g., health, energy) and are connected in the gameâ€™s grid-based layout."
- Question: "How would you implement an area-of-effect spell in a grid-based game where the spell affects all units that are connected to the starting unit and share the same state?"
# 2. Network Topology (Pathfinding or Clustering)
- Scenario: "In a network management system, you need to identify clusters of connected devices that share the same status (e.g., online, offline, error state). A device in the network is represented by a node in a 2-D grid, and devices that are horizontally or vertically connected share the same status. The system needs to identify and change the status of all connected devices starting from a given node."
- Question: "How would you implement a system that updates the status of all connected devices starting from a given device, based on connectivity in a network grid?"
# 3. Image Processing (Photo Editing Software)
- Scenario: "In a photo editing application, you have a feature to change the color of a specific region in an image. The region is defined by pixels that share the same color and are connected either horizontally or vertically. The user selects a starting pixel, and you need to change the color of all connected pixels to the selected color."
- Question: "How would you implement the 'paint bucket' tool that fills a selected region with a new color, starting from a given pixel, considering all the pixels connected to it with the same color?"
# 4. Geospatial Mapping (Flooded Area Identification)
- Scenario: "In a geospatial system, you need to identify and mark an area that is flooded based on its elevation and connectivity. The area can be represented as a grid, where each cell contains the elevation value of a terrain. A flooding region will consist of adjacent cells with the same elevation value, and you need to mark all these cells."
- Question: "Given a grid representing terrain elevations and a specific starting point, how would you flood-fill the area with a new marker for flood-affected regions that are connected by elevation?"
