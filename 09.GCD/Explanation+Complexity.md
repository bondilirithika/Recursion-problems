# TIME COMPLEXITY:
->The time complexity of Euclid's algorithm is 𝑂(log(min(𝑎,𝑏)))

->This is because the size of the numbers reduces approximately by half each step due to the modulo operation, making the algorithm very efficient.

# SPACE COMPLEXITY:
-> The space complexity is O(log(min(a,b))) due to the recursion stack in the worst case.
