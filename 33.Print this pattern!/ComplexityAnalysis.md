## Code
The `printPattern` method generates a pattern based on the minimum distance to the borders of a grid of size `(2 * N - 1) x (2 * N - 1)`. The value at each position in the grid is calculated as `N - r`, where `r` is the minimum distance from the position to any of the grid's borders (top, bottom, left, or right).

# Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `row` times, where `row = 2 * N - 1`. This results in \( O(N) \) iterations.
- **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs `col` times, where `col = 2 * N - 1`. This also results in \( O(N) \) iterations.
- **Operations Inside Loops**: Inside the nested loops, the operations performed (calculating distances and finding the minimum) are constant time operations, i.e., \( O(1) \).

**Total Time Complexity**:

The time complexity is the product of the outer and inner loops, resulting in:

\[ O(N^2) \]

# Space Complexity

- **Space for Variables**: The method uses a constant amount of extra space for storing variables (`up`, `left`, `down`, `right`, `r`), which is \( O(1) \).
- **Output Space**: The method prints directly to the console and does not use additional space to store the pattern.

**Total Space Complexity**:

The space complexity is:

\[ O(1) \]

# Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N^2) \)
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)

where `N` is the input parameter for the size of the pattern grid.
