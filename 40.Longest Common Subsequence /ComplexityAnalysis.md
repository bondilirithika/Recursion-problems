## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm uses dynamic programming with memoization to solve the LCS problem.
- It fills a 2D DP table of size (n+1)*(m+1), where n is the length of `str1` and m is the length of `str2`. Each cell is computed at most once.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m) 

### Space Complexity
The space complexity consists of:
- The O(n*m) space for the DP table.
- The recursion stack space can go up to O(n + m) in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*m)) for the DP table + O(n + m)) for recursion stack space, resulting in a total of O(n * m).
