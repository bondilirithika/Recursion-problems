# 1.Data Center Resource Allocation:
Imagine you're managing a data center where each server must be placed in a grid, and no two servers in the same row, column, or diagonal can share the same power or cooling resources. How would you find all possible configurations of server placements, ensuring no conflicts arise, similar to how queens are placed on a chessboard in the N-Queens problem?

# 2.Air Traffic Control Runway Scheduling:
In an airport, runways are arranged in a grid-like structure, and no two planes can land or take off from the same row, column, or diagonal at the same time to avoid conflicts. How would you develop a scheduling algorithm that ensures all planes are assigned to different runways, similar to the N-Queens puzzle, while satisfying these constraints?

# 3.Seating Arrangement in a Banquet Hall:
In a banquet hall, each guest must be seated at a grid of tables such that no two guests from conflicting groups are seated in the same row, column, or diagonal, similar to the N-Queens problem. How would you design a seating arrangement system to ensure that all seating conflicts are avoided?
