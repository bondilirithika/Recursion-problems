# 1. Pathfinding in Game Development:
"In a video game, the player's character starts at a specific point in a grid and must reach the end while avoiding obstacles. The character can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right). How would you implement an algorithm that generates all possible paths the character can take to reach the goal without stepping on blocked cells?"

# 2. Traffic Flow Optimization:
"Imagine you're tasked with optimizing traffic flow in a city represented as a grid. Certain roads are blocked due to construction, and vehicles can only move up, down, left, or right. How would you calculate all possible routes for vehicles to reach their destination, avoiding the blocked roads and ensuring no road is used more than once?"

# 3. Patient Transfer in a Hospital:
"Consider a hospital where a patient needs to be transferred from one ward to another through a grid of hallways. Some hallways are blocked, and the patient can only move in four directions. How would you develop a system to find all possible routes the patient can take to safely reach the destination?"

# 4. Escape Route in Emergency Situations:
Imagine you are designing an emergency evacuation system for a building, represented as a grid. Some areas are blocked, and people can move only in certain directions (up, down, left, or right). How would you develop an evacuation plan that lists all possible safe routes people can take to exit the building from a specific starting point?

# 5. Drone Delivery Route Planning:
Consider a drone that needs to deliver a package in a city represented as a grid. Certain areas are no-fly zones (blocked cells), and the drone can only move up, down, left, or right. How would you develop an algorithm that finds all possible flight paths for the drone from the starting point to the destination while avoiding no-fly zones?
