# 1. Autocorrect and Text Prediction Systems:
In developing an autocorrect or predictive text system for a messaging application, how would you create an algorithm that splits a continuous stream of characters into valid words based on a predefined dictionary? For instance, if a user types ‘iliketocook’, how would you ensure the text is segmented into ‘I like to cook’ using a dictionary of valid words?

# 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
In a Natural Language Processing task, you receive a continuous text input with no spaces between words, such as ‘machinelearningisfun’. How would you design an algorithm that segments the input into valid words (like ‘machine learning is fun’) using a dictionary of known terms?

# 3. AI-Powered Chatbots:
Imagine designing a chatbot for a customer service application where users might type long strings of text without spaces between words. How would you break the string into meaningful words using a predefined set of valid commands or dictionary terms?

# 4. Speech Recognition Systems:
In speech-to-text applications, the system often receives continuous audio data, which it translates into text without spaces between words. How would you build a system that segments this continuous text into valid dictionary words to form meaningful sentences?

# 5. Security and Password Cracking:
Suppose you're tasked with cracking a password that is a concatenation of dictionary words (like ‘ilovesecurity’). How would you approach breaking the password down into its component words using a dictionary, assuming you can use each word multiple times?
