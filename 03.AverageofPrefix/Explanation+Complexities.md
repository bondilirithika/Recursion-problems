# TIME COMPLEXITY:

-taking input from the user->O(n)

-if n is the size of the arraylist then the function will run for n+1 times->O(n) 

-printing the arraylist->O(n)

**in total**->O(3n)--O(n)

# SPACE COMPLEXITY:

-O(n)->storing the arraylist

-other variables like sum,i with constant space-->O(1)

-recursion stack max depth is n so takes space of O(n)

**in total**->O(2n+1)--O(n)
