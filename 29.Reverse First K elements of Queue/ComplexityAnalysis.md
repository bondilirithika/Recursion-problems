## Full Complexity Analysis for the Code

### Problem:
The function `modifyQueue` reverses the first `k` elements of a given queue and maintains the order of the remaining elements.

### 1. Time Complexity:

Let's break down the time complexity step by step:

1. **Extracting the first `k` elements from the queue `q` into queue `p`:**
   - You perform `poll()` and `add()` operations for each of the first `k` elements.
   - Each operation takes `O(1)`, and since there are `k` elements, this part takes `O(k)` time.

2. **Reversing the first `k` elements in queue `p`:**
   - The function `reversequeue(p)` uses recursion to reverse the queue. Since the recursion goes `k` levels deep, and each level involves one `poll()` and one `add()`, this part also takes `O(k)` time.

3. **Adding the remaining `n-k` elements back to `p`:**
   - After reversing the first `k` elements, you add the remaining `n-k` elements from queue `q` to `p`. Since each `poll()` and `add()` operation is `O(1)`, this step takes `O(n - k)` time.

### Total Time Complexity:
Summing up all the steps:

O(k) + O(k) + O(n - k) = O(n)

where `n` is the total number of elements in the queue.

### 2. Space Complexity:

- **Space for Queue `p`:** The queue `p` holds all `n` elements from the original queue `q`. Thus, the space used for `p` is `O(n)`. However, this is part of the output and not considered auxiliary space.

### 3. Auxiliary Space:

- **Recursion Stack in `reversequeue()`:** The function `reversequeue()` uses recursion, and the depth of the recursion is proportional to the number of elements being reversed, which is `k`. Each recursive call consumes stack space. Hence, the auxiliary space used by the recursion is `O(k)`.

### Summary:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of elements in the queue.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (for the queue `p`).
- **Auxiliary Space:** `O(k)`, for the recursion stack used in reversing the first `k` elements.
