# 1. Gaming (Score Multiplier Over Time)
- Scenario: "In a game, a player's score doubles at each level. Starting from 1, the score doubles as the player progresses through levels. The goal is to calculate the total score after a number of levels."
- Question: "Given that a player's score starts at 1 and doubles at each level, how would you calculate the total score after 2N levels?"
# 2. Technology (Server Resource Allocation)
- Scenario: "In cloud computing, the resources allocated to a server (e.g., memory or processing power) double after each upgrade. Starting with 1 unit of resources, you need to compute the total resources allocated after 2N upgrades."
- Question: "If the resource allocation starts at 1 unit and doubles after each upgrade, how would you calculate the total resources allocated to the server after 2N upgrades?"
# 3. Machine Learning (Model Training Over Time)
- Scenario: "In training a machine learning model, the dataset size or computation power doubles at each iteration. Starting with 1 unit of computational resources, the model uses double the resources at each step."
- Question: "Given that a machine learning model uses resources that double at each iteration, starting with 1 unit, how would you calculate the total resources used over 2N iterations?"
