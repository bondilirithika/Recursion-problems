# Geometric Progression
## Given a Geometric Progression with first term as 1, common ratio as 2 and a number N. Find out the sum of all the terms of this geometric progression if there are total 2N terms in GP.
Note: Since the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 10^9+7.

 

## Example 1:

**Input**:
N = 1

**Output**:
3

**Explanation**:
The series = 1,2. Sum = 1+2 = 3.

## Example 2:

**Input**:
N = 2

**Output**:
15

**Explanation**:
The series = 1,2,4,8. Sum = 1+2+4+8 = 15.
 
# EXPECTED COMPLEXITIES
 Expected Time Complexity: O((log(N))^2)
 
 Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

# Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^18
