## Time Complexity:
1. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function starts by checking numbers that begin with digits from 1 to 9.
   - For each starting digit, it recursively builds numbers where adjacent digits differ by 1.
   - The maximum number of such numbers that can be generated is at most `N`, so the recursive calls take **O(N)**.

2. **Sorting**:
   - After generating all valid numbers, sorting them takes **O(N log N)** time.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(N log N)**.

## Space Complexity:
- The space used is mainly for:
  1. Storing up to **O(N)** valid numbers.
  2. Recursion depth, which is proportional to the number of digits in `N`.

Hence, the space complexity is **O(N)**.
