# 1. Telecommunications Numbering Validation:
Consider a telecommunications system where certain phone numbers are considered valid only if the absolute difference between consecutive digits is exactly 1. For instance, numbers like 10 and 12 would be valid, but 15 would not. How would you write an algorithm to find all such valid numbers under a given upper limit?

# 2. Digital Security Key Generation:
In a security application, passcodes must be generated where the absolute difference between adjacent digits in the passcode is always 1, ensuring simplicity and memorability for users. If a user provides a maximum number limit, how would you generate all possible valid passcodes?

# 3.Game Development:
You're creating a puzzle game where players need to form sequences of numbers that satisfy certain conditions. One condition is that the difference between adjacent numbers must be 1. How would you implement this rule into the game's logic?

# 4.Smartphone Lock Pattern:
We're designing a new smartphone lock pattern where users swipe digits in order, but each digit must be exactly one value away from the previous. Given the maximum PIN length N, generate all valid PINs up to that length.

# 5.NetworkPacket Sequencing:
We're developing a network protocol where each packet's sequence number must differ from the previous by exactly 1. List all valid packet sequence number combinations up to N.

# 6.Cryptographic Key Generation:
We're designing a cryptographic system where each digit in the key must differ from its neighbors by exactly 1. Generate all possible keys up to N digits long.
