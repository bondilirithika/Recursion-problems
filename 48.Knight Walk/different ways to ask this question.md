# 1. Autonomous Drone Navigation:
Imagine an autonomous drone starting at a certain location and needing to navigate a complex grid to reach a destination. The drone can only move in specific patterns, similar to how a knight moves on a chessboard. How would you design an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of moves required for the drone to reach its target, and how would you handle cases where itâ€™s impossible?
# 2. Strategic Military Movement:
In a battlefield scenario, a special unit can only move in a unique pattern similar to a knight on a chessboard. The goal is to reach a strategic target location as quickly as possible. How would you develop an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of moves this unit needs to reach the target, while considering the layout of the battlefield?
# 3. AI in Game Development (Tactical Movements):
In a tactical video game, one of the characters can only move like a knight on a chessboard. The player needs to reach a specific goal in the fewest number of moves. How would you create an algorithm that calculates the shortest path for the character to reach the goal, and how would you handle unreachable destinations?
# 4. Path Optimization in Delivery Networks:
In a grid-like delivery network, a delivery bot has a restricted movement pattern, moving in L-shapes similar to a knight on a chessboard. How would you design an algorithm to find the shortest route for the bot to deliver a package from the starting point to its destination?

# 5. Emergency Response in Large Buildings:
In a large building with blocked or inaccessible areas, a responder can only move in certain patterns (like a knight's L-shape). If the responder needs to reach a target room quickly, what algorithm would you use to determine the minimum number of moves required, and how would you identify if the room is unreachable?
