# 1. Hierarchy View in Organizations
- Imagine a large company with a hierarchical structure, and you're standing at the far right of a stage where employees are lined up based on their roles and reporting relationships. From your position on the right side of the stage, you can only see certain key people from the hierarchy. How would you identify which employees are visible to you from the right side?

- This translates to finding the right view of a binary tree, where only certain nodes are visible when viewed from the right side.

# 2. Security Camera System
- Consider you are installing security cameras in a building with multiple rooms. The rooms are arranged in a branching manner, much like the structure of a binary tree. If you place a camera to the extreme right side of the building, it will capture only certain key rooms. How would you ensure that the camera captures the most important rooms, which are visible from that right-side view?

- This problem mimics finding the right view of the binary tree in terms of "capturing" the visible nodes.

# 3. Satellite Coverage over Landmasses
- Suppose a satellite is moving from east to west, capturing a snapshot of a large landmass. Due to the satellite's angle, it can only capture the prominent regions visible from its right-side view. If the landmass were structured like a tree, how would you determine which regions (nodes) would appear in the right-side snapshot?

- This scenario illustrates how a binary tree's right view can be likened to capturing regions visible from a specific angle.
