# 1. Cryptography (Public Key Encryption):
In the context of cryptography, let's say we are working with a large number N and its reverse R. To ensure that our encryption key remains secure, we need to compute N^R % (10^9 + 7), where N is a number that will be used in encryption algorithms, and R is derived from N itself. How would you compute this efficiently, especially when the resulting number can be huge?

# 2. Data Security (Hashing Algorithm):
Imagine you're designing a hashing algorithm where you need to compute a hash of a number N raised to the power of its reverse R. Given that the resulting number might be extremely large, how would you handle this situation using modular arithmetic with a modulus of 10^9 + 7? Explain your approach to ensure the hashing process is both efficient and secure.

# 3. Blockchain (Proof of Work):
In a blockchain system, you might need to calculate a proof of work based on a number N and its reverse R. The calculation involves raising N to the power of its reverse and reducing it modulo 10^9 + 7 to generate a valid proof. How would you implement this process efficiently, considering both the size of the number and the computational limitations of blockchain nodes?

# 4. Networking (Data Integrity):
In a networking application where data packets are assigned numerical identifiers, you may need to compute a checksum or hash based on a number N and its reverse R. Given the potential size of the resulting number, how would you compute the hash efficiently under modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure data integrity?
