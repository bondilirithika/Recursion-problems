# Power Of Numbers
Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.

**Note**: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

# Examples: 
**Example 1:**

**Input:**
N = 2, R = 2

**Output**: 4

**Explanation:** The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
N = 12, R = 21

**Output:** 864354781

**Explanation:** The reverse of 12 is 21and 1221 when divided by 1000000007 gives remainder as 864354781.

# Complexity:
Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(LogN).

# Constraints:
