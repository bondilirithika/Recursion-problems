# 1. E-Commerce/Online Shopping (Discount Calculation for Multiple Items)
Scenario: "Imagine you are building an e-commerce platform, and you're tasked with calculating all possible combinations of discounts on items in a shopping cart. Each discount is applied as a consecutive subset of items selected from the cart, and the final value depends on all possible combinations of consecutive items."
# 2. Algorithmic Trading (Stock Price Changes)
- Scenario: "In algorithmic trading, stock prices fluctuate over time, and you need to calculate the sum of all possible sub-sequences of stock price changes over consecutive periods."
- Question: "Given a sequence of stock price changes represented as a string of digits (e.g., '1234'), how would you compute the sum of all possible consecutive price combinations for analysis?"
