# 1. Networking (Packet Prioritization):
"In networking, we often have a buffer of packets waiting to be transmitted. These packets can have different priority levels based on their importance. You are tasked with sorting the packets in the buffer so that the highest priority packet is always processed first. How would you efficiently sort the buffer using a data structure similar to a stack?
# 2. Game Development (Player Score Sorting):
In a game, you have a stack that holds players' scores. The task is to sort the stack such that the highest score is at the top of the stack. How would you implement an algorithm to sort the stack so that the top element represents the highest score?

# 3. Customer Service (Request Sorting):
In a customer service application, you receive a stack of support requests, where each request has a priority score. Your goal is to reorder the stack so that the request with the highest priority is at the top. How would you approach sorting the stack based on the priority of the requests?
# 4. Supply Chain Management (Product Sorting):
In a supply chain management system, you have a stack of products that are waiting to be shipped. The products have different weights, and you need to ensure that the heaviest product is always at the top of the stack for processing. How would you sort this stack to ensure the heaviest product is at the top?

# 5. Stock Market (Price Sorting):
In a stock market application, you have a stack of stock prices recorded at different times. You need to sort this stack such that the highest price is always at the top. How would you approach sorting the stack of stock prices in real-time?

# 6. Customer Queue Management (Prioritization):
Imagine you're designing a customer service system where requests are handled in a stack-like manner. Each request has a priority value, and you need to ensure that the most urgent requests (with the highest priority values) are handled first. How would you implement a method to reorder the stack based on priority, ensuring the highest priority request is at the top?
