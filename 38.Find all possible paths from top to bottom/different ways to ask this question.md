# 1. Logistics (Package Delivery Route)
Imagine you are in charge of planning routes for delivering packages in a warehouse that is structured as a grid. You can either move right or down through the aisles to deliver packages. How would you determine all the possible routes a robot can take to deliver packages from the top-left corner of the warehouse to the bottom-right corner?
# 2. Game Development (Grid-based Character Movement)
In a 2D grid-based game, the character can only move right or down to reach the target at the bottom-right corner. How would you find all possible routes that the character can take to complete the level, while ensuring no illegal moves (like diagonal movement) are made?

# 3. Transportation (Highway Route Design)
Designing a highway network where roads follow a grid structure and cars can only move right or down due to city planning restrictions. The goal is to find all potential routes a car can take from the starting point (top-left) to the destination (bottom-right) without violating traffic flow constraints.

# 4. Emergency Services (Evacuation Route Planning)
In a disaster scenario, the emergency services need to plan all possible evacuation routes from the top-left (an entry point) to the bottom-right (safe zone). Movement can only be to the right or down due to road closures or environmental factors. How can the team determine all viable escape routes?
